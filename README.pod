=item * L<Jira Core REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/server/>

This rich API superseded the old L<Jira SOAP
API|http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html>
which isn't supported anymore as of Jira version 7.

=item * L<Jira Service Desk REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/server/>

This API deals with the objects of the Jira Service Desk application.

=item * L<Jira Software REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/server/>

This API deals with the objects of the Jira Software application.
