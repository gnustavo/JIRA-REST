=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<JIRA|http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/> is a proprietary bug
tracking system from Atlassian.

This module implements a very thin wrapper around JIRA's REST APIs:

=over

=item * L<JIRA Core REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira/REST/server/>

This rich API superseded the old L<JIRA SOAP
API|http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html>
which isn't supported anymore as of JIRA version 7.

The endpoints of this API have a path prefix of C</rest/api/VERSION>.

=item * L<JIRA Service Desk REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-servicedesk/REST/server/>

This API deals with the objects of the JIRA Service Desk application. Its
endpoints have a path prefix of C</rest/servicedeskapi>.

=item * L<JIRA Software REST API|https://docs.atlassian.com/jira-software/REST/server/>

This API deals with the objects of the JIRA Software application. Its
endpoints have a path prefix of C</rest/agile/VERSION>.

=back

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new HASHREF

=head2 new URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD, REST_CLIENT_CONFIG, ANONYMOUS, PROXY, SSL_VERIFY_NONE

The constructor can take its arguments from a single hash reference or from
a list of positional parameters. The first form is preferred because it lets
you specify only the arguments you need. The second form forces you to pass
undefined values if you need to pass a specific value to an argument further
to the right.

The arguments are described below with the names which must be used as the
hash keys:

=over 4

=item * B<url>

A string or a URI object denoting the base URL of the JIRA server. This is a
required argument.

The REST methods described below all accept as a first argument the
endpoint's path of the specific API method to call. In general you can pass
the complete path, beginning with the prefix denoting the particular API to
use (C</rest/api/VERSION>, C</rest/servicedeskapi>, or
C</rest/agile/VERSION>). However, you may specify a default API prefix by
suffixing the URL with it. For example:

    my $jira = JIRA::REST->new({
        url      => 'https://jira.example.net/jira/rest/api/1',
        username => 'myuser',
        password => 'mypass'
    });

    $jira->GET('/rest/api/1/issue/TST-1');
    $jira->GET('/issue/TST-1');

With this constructor call both GET methods are the same, because the second
one does not specify an API prefix. This is useful if you mainly want to use
a particular API or if you want to specify a particular version of an API
during construction.

=item * B<username>

=item * B<password>

The username and password of a JIRA user to use for authentication.

If B<anonymous> is false then, if either B<username> or B<password> isn't
defined the module looks them up in either the C<.netrc> file or via
L<Config::Identity> (which allows C<gpg> encrypted credentials).

L<Config::Identity> will look for F<~/.jira-identity> or F<~/.jira>.
You can change the filename stub from C<jira> to a custom stub with the
C<JIRA_REST_IDENTITY> environment variable.

=item * B<rest_client_config>

A JIRA::REST object uses a L<REST::Client> object to make the REST
invocations. This optional argument must be a hash reference that can be fed
to the REST::Client constructor. Note that the C<url> argument
overwrites any value associated with the C<host> key in this hash.

As an extension, the hash reference also accepts one additional argument
called B<proxy> that is an extension to the REST::Client configuration and
will be removed from the hash before passing it on to the REST::Client
constructor. However, this argument is deprecated since v0.017 and you
should avoid it. Instead, use the following argument instead.

=item * B<proxy>

To use a network proxy set this argument to the string or URI object
describing the fully qualified URL (including port) to your network proxy.

=item * B<ssl_verify_none>

Sets the C<SSL_verify_mode> and C<verify_hostname ssl> options on the
underlying L<REST::Client>'s user agent to 0, thus disabling them. This
allows access to JIRA servers that have self-signed certificates that don't
pass L<LWP::UserAgent>'s verification methods.

=item * B<anonymous>

Tells the module that you want to connect to the specified JIRA server with
no username or password.  This way you can access public JIRA servers
without needing to authenticate.

=back

=head1 REST METHODS

JIRA's REST API documentation lists dozens of "resources" which can be
operated via the standard HTTP requests: GET, DELETE, PUT, and
POST. JIRA::REST objects implement four methods called GET, DELETE,
PUT, and POST to make it easier to invoke and get results from JIRA's
REST endpoints.

All four methods need two arguments:

=over

=item * RESOURCE

This is the resource's 'path'. For example, in order to GET the list of all
fields, you pass C</rest/api/latest/field>, and in order to get SLA
information about an issue you pass
C</rest/servicedeskapi/request/$key/sla>.

If you're using a method form JIRA Core REST API you may omit the prefix
C</rest/api/VERSION>. For example, to GET the list of all fields you may
pass just C</field>.

This argument is required.

=item * QUERY

Some resource methods require or admit parameters which are passed as
a C<query-string> appended to the resource's path. You may construct
the query string and append it to the RESOURCE argument yourself, but
it's easier and safer to pass the arguments in a hash. This way the
query string is constructed for you and its values are properly
L<percent-encoded|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding> to
avoid errors.

This argument is optional for GET and DELETE. For PUT and POST it must
be passed explicitly as C<undef> if not needed.

=back

The PUT and POST methods accept two more arguments:

=over

=item * VALUE

This is the "entity" being PUT or POSTed. It can be any value, but
usually is a hash reference. The value is encoded as a
L<JSON|http://www.json.org/> string using the C<JSON::encode> method
and sent with a Content-Type of C<application/json>.

It's usually easy to infer from the JIRA REST API documentation which
kind of value you should pass to each resource.

This argument is required.

=item * HEADERS

This optional argument allows you to specify extra HTTP headers that
should be sent with the request. Each header is specified as a
key/value pair in a hash.

=back

All four methods return the value returned by the associated
resource's method, as specified in the documentation, decoded
according to its content type as follows:

=over

=item * application/json

The majority of the API's resources return JSON values. Those are
decoded using the C<decode> method of a C<JSON> object. Most of the
endpoints return hashes, which are returned as a Perl hash reference.

=item * text/plain

Those values are returned as simple strings.

=back

Some endpoints don't return anything. In those cases, the methods
return C<undef>. The methods croak if they get any other type of
values in return.

In case of errors (i.e., if the underlying HTTP method return an error
code different from 2xx) the methods croak with a multi-line string
like this:

    ERROR: <CODE> - <MESSAGE>
    <CONTENT-TYPE>
    <CONTENT>

So, in order to treat errors you must invoke the methods in an eval
block or use any of the exception handling Perl modules, such as
C<Try::Tiny> and C<Try::Catch>.

=head2 GET RESOURCE [, QUERY]

Returns the RESOURCE as a Perl data structure.

=head2 DELETE RESOURCE [, QUERY]

Deletes the RESOURCE.

=head2 PUT RESOURCE, QUERY, VALUE [, HEADERS]

Creates RESOURCE based on VALUE.

=head2 POST RESOURCE, QUERY, VALUE [, HEADERS]

Updates RESOURCE based on VALUE.

=head1 UTILITY METHODS

This module provides a few utility methods.

=head2 B<set_search_iterator> PARAMS

Sets up an iterator for the search specified by the hash reference PARAMS.
It must be called before calls to B<next_issue>.

PARAMS must conform with the query parameters allowed for the
C</rest/api/2/search> JIRA REST endpoint.

=head2 B<next_issue>

This must be called after a call to B<set_search_iterator>. Each call
returns a reference to the next issue from the filter. When there are no
more issues it returns undef.

Using the set_search_iterator/next_issue utility methods you can iterate
through large sets of issues without worrying about the startAt/total/offset
attributes in the response from the /search REST endpoint. These methods
implement the "paging" algorithm needed to work with those attributes.

=head2 B<attach_files> ISSUE FILE...

The C</issue/KEY/attachments> REST endpoint, used to attach files to issues,
requires a specific content type encoding which is difficult to come up with
just the C<REST::Client> interface. This utility method offers an easier
interface to attach files to issues.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item * C<REST::Client>

JIRA::REST uses a REST::Client object to perform the low-level interactions.

=item * C<JIRA::Client::REST>

This is another module implementing JIRA's REST API using
