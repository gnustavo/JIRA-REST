  [Enhancement]

  - JIRA::REST gives up on trying to decode the error messages returned by
    Jira. They are inconsistent and undocumented, as far as I know. From now on,
    we simply show the JSON object containing the error message.

  - Don't croak anymore on the PUT and POST methods when the third argument
    (value) is undefined. There are API endpoints for which this makes sense.

0.023     2022-04-10 20:54:14-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New features]

  - Implement the new JIRA::REST::rest_client auxiliary method to make it
    OK to get to the underlying REST::Client object.

  [Documentation]

  - Implement two new example scripts showing how to deal with attachments. The
    download_attachment.pl script uses the new J::R::rest_client method.

  - Update the Perl and Jira Compatibility Policy section.

0.022     2021-12-19 16:22:52-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Deprecation]

  - The new_session constructor is deprecated. New code should use the 'session'
    argument to the default constructor.

  [New features]

  - Martin Sluka kindly added support for Personal Access Tokens so that it's
    now possible to authenticate without usernames and passwords. This requires
    at least Jira 8.14.

  - Add the 'session' argument to the constructor.

  [Enhancement]

  - Martin Sluka also kindly contributed code to make JIRA::REST do not send
    Authorization HTTP headers if we've set up a session. This lessens the
    burden to Jira, which may be significant for scripts making lots of calls.

  - The example scripts were refactored to be modernized.

  [Deprecation]

  - Since CentOS 6 reached EOL on December/2020, following our policy we're
    dropping support for it and, consequently, for Perl 5.10. Now Jira::REST
    requires Perl 5.16, which ships with CentOS 7, which will reach EOL on July,
    2024.

  [Enhancement]

  - Now the constructor sets up a cookie jar on the LWP::UserAgent object
    inside, so that it can keep and use the session cookies it gets from the
    server, making it possible to establish and keep user sessions. This is
    particularly useful when interacting with Jira Data Center instances.

  [New feature]

  - A new constructor called 'new_session' is implemented. It accepts the same
    options as the default constructor 'new', invokes it and then creates a user
    session, which is destroyed during destruction of the JIRA::REST
    object.

0.020     2019-11-02 23:13:42-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Documentation]

  - Some fixes, a new reference to JIRA::REST::OAuth, a new example script
    showing how to add a comment.

0.019     2018-07-28 18:00:17-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - JIRA::REST now requires at least Perl 5.10. Previously it required Perl
    5.8. A new section in the documentation explains our Perl and Jira
    compatibility Policy.

  [Fixes]

  - William Carr fixed the sub_error routine teaching it yet another way Jira
    can pass error messages back.

  [Documentation]

  - Lisa Hare graciously contributed some example scripts which can be found on
    the 'examples' directory.

  - All mentions of 'JIRA' were changed to 'Jira', following the change
    Atlassian made in all of its site and documentation.

0.018     2017-05-30 09:38:37-03:00 America/Sao_Paulo

0.014     2016-11-23 07:27:52-02:00 America/Sao_Paulo

  [New feature]

  - JIRA::REST now supports the JIRA Software REST API and the JIRA Service
    Desk REST API in addition to the JIRA Core REST API with a minimal
    change. How cool is that!?

0.009     2014-09-09 20:32:15 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - Fix the set_search_iterator/next_issue pair of methods.

  [Changes]

  - The iterators now use JIRA's own default (which is 50) when the
    'maxResults' argument isn't set. Previously our default was set to 256.

0.008     2014-09-06 19:14:06 America/Sao_Paulo

0.005     2014-08-07 20:25:14 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Changes]

  - New utility methods 'set_search_iterator' and 'next_issue' make it
    easier to iterate through large sets of issues without having to deal
    with "pagination".

  - Error messages are not presented in a consistent format. JIRA errors are
    parsed and presented in a legible way.

0.004     2013-12-14 14:54:06 America/Sao_Paulo

  [Fixes]

  - [RT-91368] Some resource responses contain no content but specify
    a Content-Type. Those were being considered errors. Now they
    simply return undef.

  - When a resource response contains a content but doesn't specify a
    Content-Type it's an error. Previously it was returning undef.
